## Frequently asked questions:

(also a good place for beginners)


### **Q:** Why use this over Polygon?

**A:** ASIMON offers a subset of the [Polygon](https://polygon.codeforces.com/) problem preparation system. These are the reason you may want to use it:
- Local hosting.
- Very simple layout.
- Full control (and responsibility) over what you do.
- Multithread support (especially useful for problems with great time complexity e.g. $O(n^3)$ where $n=420$).
- You are creating problems for anything other than Codeforces contests (if not, just use Polygon :)



### **Q:** What would a created problem look like?

**A:** See [this](/docs/created_problem.md).


### **Q:** Why are there no support for problem statement and solution? 

**A:** Because in most use cases you will write them (and host the problem) elsewhere. ASIMON cover most of your workflow except that; however, you can write your statement and solution in the `workspace` folder and the `create_problem.py` tool will bundle that, along with any miscellaneous files, into your saved problem folder anyway.
